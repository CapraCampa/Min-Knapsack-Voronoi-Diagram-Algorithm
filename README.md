# Min-Knapsack-Voronoi-Diagram-Algorithm
C++ implementation of an original algorithm that computes the Min Knapsack variant of the Voronoi diagram.
Given a set of points, their individual capacity and a total threshold to reach it outputs a Min Knapsack Voronoi Diagram (MKVD).

For a more detailed definition of the structure read the article written by professor Plastria in 2016 **"Up- and downgrading the euclidean 1-median problem and knapsack Voronoi diagrams"**.

This project uses the following libraries: 
- **MyGal** library by pvigier to compute the Voronoi diagram of first order (https://github.com/pvigier/MyGAL)
- **SFML** library to visualize the diagram (https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)
